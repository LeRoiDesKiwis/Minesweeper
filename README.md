# How to play
[wikipedia's page of Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))

You have to launch it from the shell. Otherwise it won't work.

Once the game started, you can use three commands :
- exit : to quit the game
- flag <coordinates> : to flag a cell
- reveal <coordinates> : to reveal a cell
- help : to show the help
  
Once you made one of these commands, the map will appear :
- â–  means that the cell isn't revealed
- B means that there is a bomb here
- F means that you flagged this cell
- <number> means that there are <number> bombs near this cell

That's all. Have a good game! :)
